    question: "What is business storage?",

      "Business storage allows companies to store stock, equipment, documents, furniture, supplies, and operational items in a managed warehouse without leasing additional premises.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does business storage cost?",
    answer:
      "Pricing depends on the quantity and type of boxes, individual items or pallets stored, the storage duration, collection requirements, and return-delivery needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to rent an entire storage unit?",
    answer:
      "No. KXH provides managed storage based on the items and storage capacity your business actually requires.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you collect items from my business?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can collect from offices, shops, warehouses, studios, commercial premises, and other approved London locations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I increase or reduce my storage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your storage requirement can be reviewed as stock levels and operational needs change.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you store boxes, individual items, and pallets?",
    answer:
      "Yes. KXH can support boxes, office equipment, furniture, business stock, cartons, commercial assets, and palletised goods, subject to suitability.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does inventory organisation work?",
    answer:
      "Stored items are organised through warehouse handling and inventory-record processes so they can be identified and requested more efficiently.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I request selected items back?",
    answer:
      "Where supported by the selected service, you can request particular boxes, items, stock, or pallets rather than returning the full storage load.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I request return delivery?",
    answer:
      "Return delivery requests are submitted through our online request form, similar to requesting a storage quote. Tell us which stored items you need returned, where they should be delivered, and your preferred delivery date. After reviewing your request, the KXH team will confirm availability, delivery arrangements, and any applicable charges before scheduling the return."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a minimum storage period?",
    answer:
      "Minimum storage periods may depend on the item type and selected service. Your applicable storage term will be confirmed before booking.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you collect from multiple business locations?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Depending on your storage requirements, KXH can arrange collection from multiple approved business locations across London. Speak with our team to discuss your collection requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I access only part of my stored items?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If you only require selected boxes, equipment, stock, or pallets, contact our team and we can arrange retrieval and return delivery for the required items rather than your entire stored load."
