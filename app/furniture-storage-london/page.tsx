        question: "Can you collect furniture from multiple offices?",
        answer:
            "Multiple collection points can be discussed as part of a consolidation, relocation or refurbishment project. Pricing and scheduling depend on the number of sites, access, furniture volume, labour and transport requirements.",
    },

        question: "Can more furniture be added after the first collection?",
        answer:
            "Ongoing additions may be possible where they fit the agreed storage and inventory workflow. Tell KXH how frequently new items are likely to arrive so collection, organisation and pricing can be planned.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is this the same as self storage?",
        answer:
            "No. Self storage normally provides a unit that your team must transport furniture to, organise, visit and manage. KXH provides a managed furniture-storage workflow that can include collection, handling, inventory organisation, storage, retrieval and return delivery.",

    {
        question: "Can you store furniture awaiting installation?",
        answer:
            "Yes. Furniture can be held while a site is being prepared, access is delayed, contractors complete fit-out work or installation dates are finalised.",
    },
    {
        question: "What information is needed for a quote?",
        answer:

    {
        question: "Can furniture be grouped by department or project?",

            "Yes. Furniture can be organised around practical references such as department, floor, room, project, client, site, asset number or supplied manifest where agreed.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide assembly or installation?",
        answer:
            "Any dismantling, reassembly or installation requirement should be discussed during quotation. Availability and pricing depend on the furniture type, complexity, access and project scope.",
    },
    {
        question: "What furniture may not be suitable for storage?",
        answer:
            "Suitability depends on condition, dimensions, materials, contamination risk, packaging, handling requirements and available warehouse capacity. KXH should review unusual, damaged, wet, infested, hazardous or exceptionally valuable items before collection is agreed.",
