    question: "What is inventory storage?",

      "Inventory storage is a managed service for keeping physical business stock, supplies, equipment or other suitable goods away from your main premises. KXH can combine storage with collection, organised item records, retrieval coordination and return delivery under an agreed arrangement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this inventory software?",
    answer:
      "No. This page describes physical inventory storage and warehouse handling, not a standalone SaaS platform, ERP system, customer dashboard or live stock-control application.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are stored items recorded?",
    answer:
      "The recording method depends on the agreed storage arrangement. Suitable items may be grouped and referenced by category, box, unit or pallet using practical stored-item records.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you create an inventory list or manifest?",
    answer:
      "An item list or inventory manifest may be available for suitable storage jobs. The level of detail should be agreed during quotation so the record matches the type and volume of stock being stored.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you collect inventory from business premises?",
    answer:
      "Collection can be arranged from an agreed London business location. The quote will reflect the collection address, volume, access conditions, handling needs and storage arrangement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can inventory be returned on request?",
    answer:
      "Yes, retrieval and return delivery can be coordinated under the agreed service. Timing, handling requirements and any delivery charges should be confirmed with the KXH team when arranging the return.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you store pallets?",
    answer:
      "KXH supports pallet and bulk-stock enquiries. Pallet type, dimensions, weight, goods, volume and handling requirements must be reviewed during quotation to confirm suitability.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of business stock can be stored?",
    answer:
      "Potentially suitable items include ecommerce products, retail stock, packaging, office supplies, event materials, tools, equipment, seasonal goods, archived boxes and palletised stock. Suitability is confirmed before booking, and hazardous, illegal, regulated or temperature-sensitive items should not be assumed acceptable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can storage scale during seasonal demand?",
    answer:
      "Storage requirements can be reviewed when stock volumes rise or fall. Availability, handling and pricing will depend on the updated quantity and the most suitable storage format.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is inventory storage pricing calculated?",
    answer:
      "Pricing depends on the volume and type of inventory, collection requirements, storage duration, handling needs, pallet requirements and expected return-delivery arrangements. KXH will provide a quote based on the details supplied.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can businesses visit or directly access stored goods?",

    question: "Which London areas do you serve?",

          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-slate-600">
            At KXH, inventory management means helping businesses store and organise
            physical goods inside a managed warehouse arrangement. It does not mean
            selling inventory software or providing a live customer dashboard.
          </p>

            <p>
              Depending on the agreed service, items can be collected, grouped, recorded
              and placed into suitable storage. This gives businesses clearer visibility
              over stored stock while avoiding the overhead of leasing and operating extra
              warehouse space.
            </p>
            <p>
              When stock is needed again, retrieval and return delivery can be coordinated.
              Storage capacity can also be reviewed as inventory volumes change.
