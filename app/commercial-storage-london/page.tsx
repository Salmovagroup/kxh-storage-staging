const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is commercial storage?",
    a: "Commercial storage is warehouse-based storage designed around business operations. It can be used for inventory, equipment, archives, office assets, project materials and overflow stock. Unlike a basic self-storage unit, a managed commercial service can include collection, warehouse handling, organised storage and return delivery.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is commercial storage different from self storage?",
    a: "Self storage usually requires your team to transport, load, unload and organise everything themselves. KXH provides a managed service: we can collect from your premises, handle items inside the warehouse, organise stored goods and return them when requested. This is often more practical for businesses without vehicles, labour or time to manage a storage unit.",
  },
  {
    q: "What types of businesses use commercial storage in London?",
    a: "We support retailers, ecommerce brands, offices, contractors, hospitality operators, schools, healthcare organisations, event teams, manufacturers and other companies that need flexible warehouse capacity without taking on another commercial lease.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you store commercial inventory and retail stock?",
    a: "Yes. We store boxed inventory, retail stock, promotional materials, packaged goods, business supplies and other commercial items. The right setup depends on item type, quantity, handling needs and expected collection or return frequency.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide collection and return delivery?",
    a: "Yes. KXH can arrange collection from business premises across London and return stored items when required. Delivery requirements, access restrictions, item volumes and handling needs are confirmed during quoting.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can storage capacity increase during busy periods?",
    a: "Yes. Commercial storage can flex around seasonal peaks, contract wins, refurbishment projects, stock arrivals and temporary warehouse overflow. You can discuss increases or reductions in required capacity with our team as your operational needs change.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is commercial storage suitable for warehouse overflow?",
    a: "Yes. Overflow storage is useful when your existing warehouse, stockroom, office or site cannot safely hold incoming goods. It can provide temporary capacity while you clear backlog, reorganise operations, complete a move or manage peak demand.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you store office furniture and business equipment?",
    a: "Yes. We can store desks, chairs, cabinets, boxed IT equipment, displays, tools, fixtures and other business assets, subject to item suitability and an agreed handling plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer archive and document storage?",
    a: "We can store boxed business archives and records that need to be retained but do not require daily access. Tell us how the boxes are labelled and how often you expect retrievals so we can recommend an appropriate arrangement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a minimum or maximum storage period?",
    a: "Commercial requirements vary, so storage can be discussed for short-term projects, seasonal needs and longer operational use. Your quote will confirm the agreed storage arrangement, collection requirements and any expected return schedule.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I access the warehouse directly?",
    a: "KXH operates as a managed storage service rather than a walk-in self-storage facility. Instead of requiring your team to visit and handle goods, we coordinate warehouse retrieval and return delivery. This reduces transport and labour demands on your business.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can you collect commercial items?",
    a: "Timing depends on volume, location, vehicle requirements, access conditions and current scheduling. Share your preferred date and item list when requesting a quote, and our team will confirm the available collection options.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does commercial storage in London cost?",
    a: "Pricing depends on the amount of space required, item type, storage duration, collection and delivery requirements, access conditions and handling complexity. We provide a tailored quote so your business pays for the service it actually needs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What information do you need for a commercial storage quote?",
    a: "It helps to provide your collection postcode, item types, approximate quantities or photos, preferred collection date, expected storage duration and any delivery or access restrictions. For larger projects, we may ask additional questions before confirming the plan.",
  },

          <div className="mt-6 space-y-5 text-base leading-8 text-slate-600">
            <p>
              Commercial storage is flexible warehouse space used to support day-to-day operations,
              growth, projects and business continuity. It gives companies somewhere suitable to hold
              inventory, equipment, archives, furniture, supplies and other assets that no longer fit
              safely or efficiently at the main workplace.
            </p>
            <p>
              The important difference is that commercial storage is built around operational needs.
              A retailer may need overflow capacity before peak season. A contractor may need secure
              space between projects. An office may need furniture stored during a relocation. A growing
              ecommerce brand may need stock removed from a home, studio or undersized unit.
            </p>
            <p>
              KXH provides managed warehouse storage rather than simply handing you an empty room. We can
              arrange collection, receive and handle items, organise them within the warehouse and return
              what you need. Your team avoids repeated van hire, manual loading and time-consuming trips
              to a self-storage facility.
