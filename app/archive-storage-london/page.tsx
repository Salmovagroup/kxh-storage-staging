const faqs = [
    { question: "How secure is archive storage?", answer: "KXH provides managed physical archive storage inside a business warehouse environment. Security, access, collection, handling, indexing, retrieval, and delivery requirements should be discussed during quotation so the proposed service matches the confidentiality and operational needs of your records." },
    { question: "Do you collect archive boxes from London businesses?", answer: "Yes. KXH can arrange archive collection from offices, commercial premises, project sites, former business locations, and other agreed addresses across London. Collection requirements are priced according to volume, access, location, handling, and transport needs." },
    { question: "Can I retrieve individual files or archive boxes?", answer: "KXH can arrange retrieval of selected archive boxes or identified records where the archive has been organised with suitable references. The practical retrieval method depends on the indexing information, labels, manifests, and level of document identification agreed for your service." },
    { question: "Do you store legal documents?", answer: "Yes, subject to suitability and agreed handling requirements. Legal archives may include closed matter files, contracts, property records, correspondence, case documents, and other retained business records." },
    { question: "Can you store medical records?", answer: "KXH can discuss storage of approved physical medical, care, administrative, and healthcare records. The organisation must explain applicable confidentiality, retention, access, and handling requirements so suitability can be assessed before collection." },
    { question: "Can you collect archives directly from my office?", answer: "Yes. Our managed model is designed to reduce the need for businesses to visit a storage unit. We can collect boxed archives from the office, transport them to storage, organise them using agreed references, and arrange retrieval and delivery later." },
    { question: "How long can archives remain in storage?", answer: "Archive storage can support temporary, medium-term, rolling, or long-term requirements. The appropriate arrangement depends on archive volume, retention policy, review dates, retrieval frequency, and any planned destruction or return programme." },
    { question: "How are archive boxes organised?", answer: "Boxes may be organised using existing labels, box numbers, departments, date ranges, client or project references, retention categories, manifests, or another agreed physical archive structure. KXH is not cloud storage or document-management software; the service concerns real boxes and records held in the warehouse." },
    { question: "Do you provide archive delivery?", answer: "Yes. Selected archives or a full stored collection can be returned to an agreed address. Delivery timing, volume, handling, access, and any re-storage requirement are confirmed before the movement is scheduled." },
    { question: "Can archived documents be retrieved quickly?", answer: "Retrieval speed depends on how the archive is indexed, the quantity requested, warehouse handling requirements, delivery location, and scheduling availability. Businesses with frequent or time-sensitive retrieval needs should explain those expectations during quotation." },
    { question: "Is KXH archive storage the same as self storage?", answer: "No. Self storage generally provides a unit that your team must transport records to, organise, visit, and manage. KXH provides a managed archive workflow that can include collection, transport, organisation, warehouse storage, retrieval, and return delivery." },
    { question: "Is this digital document storage or cloud archiving?", answer: "No. KXH stores physical archive boxes, paper files, bound records, drawings, plans, and approved business documentation. We do not present this service as cloud storage, scanning software, electronic records management, or a digital document platform." },
    { question: "Can you store confidential business records?", answer: "KXH can discuss confidential document storage where the records, packaging, indexing, handling, access, and retrieval requirements are suitable for the service. Businesses remain responsible for explaining any sector-specific, contractual, legal, or internal controls that apply." },
    { question: "Can you help during an office relocation or downsizing?", answer: "Yes. Archive collection can be coordinated before an office move, consolidation, refurbishment, or downsizing project. Inactive records can remain offsite while active files, furniture, and equipment move to the new workplace." },
    { question: "What happens when records reach the end of their retention period?", answer: "You can request return, continued storage, review, or an agreed shredding service for eligible records. Destruction should only proceed with clear authorisation from the organisation responsible for the documents and in line with its retention policy." },
    { question: "Do archive boxes need to be indexed before collection?", answer: "Not always. Existing box lists, labels, manifests, departments, project references or date ranges are useful, but the required level of organisation can be discussed during quotation. Retrieval is easier when each box or record group has a clear agreed identifier." },
    { question: "Can you collect archives from more than one London office?", answer: "Multiple collection points can be discussed as part of an archive consolidation or office-relocation project. Pricing and scheduling depend on the number of locations, archive volume, access, handling and transport requirements." },
    { question: "Can more archive boxes be added after the initial collection?", answer: "Ongoing additions may be possible where they fit the agreed storage and inventory process. Tell KXH how frequently new boxes are likely to be added so collection, labelling, storage records and pricing can be planned appropriately." },

                        Retrieval is a core part of the managed service. Where archives
                        are stored under suitable references, your team can request
                        particular boxes, project files, departmental records, date
                        ranges, or a complete stored archive.

                        Timing depends on the quality of the archive references, the
                        number of records requested, warehouse handling, delivery
                        location, and scheduling availability. Frequent or
                        time-sensitive retrieval requirements should be agreed during
                        quotation.
