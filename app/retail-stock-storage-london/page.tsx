    },
    {
        question: "Can you store mannequins and visual-merchandising equipment?",

    },
    {
        question: "Can you store Black Friday or Christmas stock?",
        answer:
            "Yes. Flexible managed storage is suitable for peak-season inventory, gift sets, packaging, displays, promotional materials, and reserve stock that is not yet needed in store.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you store clearance or slow-moving stock?",
        answer:
            "Suitable clearance, discontinued, reserve, and slow-moving inventory can be separated from active store stock while the retailer decides how and when it should be sold or redistributed.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can suppliers deliver directly to KXH?",
        answer:
            "Direct supplier delivery or supplier collection may be possible when arranged in advance and approved as part of the service. Delivery details, quantities, access, and handling must be confirmed first.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is this the same as ecommerce fulfilment?",
        answer:
            "No. This page primarily describes managed physical storage, organisation, collection, and return delivery. Order-by-order ecommerce fulfilment is a different operational service and must be confirmed separately.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you store mixed cartons and pallets?",
        answer:
            "Suitable mixed storage may be possible, including cartons, loose retail assets, fixtures, and palletised inventory. KXH will assess item types, dimensions, quantities, and handling needs before confirming the quote.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you collect from a shopping centre?",
        answer:
            "Potentially. Shopping-centre collections depend on loading-bay rules, booking windows, vehicle access, security requirements, item volume, and any restrictions imposed by the premises.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does retail storage connect to Business Storage London?",
        answer:
            "Retail Stock Storage London is a specialist service page within the wider KXH Business Storage London pillar. The parent service also covers ecommerce stock, office assets, pallets, commercial equipment, collection, organised warehousing, and return delivery.",
